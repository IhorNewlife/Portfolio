			<p class="experience__about">
				In every job, I had to talk to a lot of people, which increased my soft skills, made me stress-resistant and
				my
				mind analytical. I always liked programming, the look of the code, but I did not know what language to
				choose, and I was helped to decide in the "Go It" academy.I
				finished courses at the academy <a href="https://goit.ua/" class="experience__link">"Go It"</a>, on full
				stack developer, and now I will
				freelance in parallel with my main job. In addition to personal projects, I also worked in a team. I like
				making up interesting layouts, love writing code, playing video games, and socializing with friends and
				colleagues.
